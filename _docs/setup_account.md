# Setup Account

- [Setup Account](#setup-account)
  - [Region](#region)

Setup is done entirely via the [integration UI](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=carbon_intensity).

## Region

In order to provide accurate readings, you'll need to set the region you're tracking. This will be used to work out the carbon intensity in your area.
